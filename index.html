      <h2>Powerful, Simple, and Fast</h2>
      <p>DNAAT is designed for bioinformaticians, students, and researchers who need a straightforward tool for sequence analysis without the overhead of heavy software. By implementing core algorithms in C, DNAAT offers significant performance gains over pure Python implementations.</p>

      <h2>Core Features</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Global Alignment (Needleman-Wunsch)</strong>: Ideal for comparing two sequences of similar lengths from end to end.</li>
        <li><strong>Local Alignment (Smith-Waterman)</strong>: Perfect for finding the most similar sub-regions between two sequences.</li>
        <li><strong>C-Accelerated Performance</strong>: Critical functions are written in C for maximum speed, with a simple Python wrapper for ease of use.</li>
        <li><strong>Visualization</strong>: Generate and view alignment score grids and optimal alignment paths with Matplotlib.</li>
      </ul>
