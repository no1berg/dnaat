    <h2>Project Background</h2>
    <p>DNAseqer was created to provide a fast and accessible way to analyze DNA sequences without the need for complex
      software installations or dependencies. It is written in Python and designed to run on any system with minimal
      setup.</p>

    <h2>Goals</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Provide a lightweight tool for basic DNA sequence aligment and visualization.</li>
      <li>Maintain simplicity and ease of use through a command-line interface.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Development Status</h2>
    <p>DNAAT is currently a work in progress. While the core functionality is implemented, additional features and
      improvments are planned. Contributions and feedback are welcome.</p>
