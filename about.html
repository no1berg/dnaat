    <h2>Project Background</h2>
    <p>DNAAT was created to provide a fast and accessible way to analyze DNA sequences without the need for complex software installations or dependencies. It is written in Python with performance-critical functions accelerated in C, and is designed to run on any system with minimal setup.</p>

    <h2>Goals</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Provide a lightweight tool for both global (Needleman-Wunsch) and local (Smith-Waterman) DNA sequence alignment.</li>
      <li>Maintain simplicity and ease of use through a command-line interface.</li>
      <li>Offer visualization of alignment scores and paths.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Development Status</h2>
    <p>The core functionality for both local and global alignment is implemented. While the tool is fully functional, additional features and improvements are always being considered. Contributions and feedback from the community are welcome.</p>
