# DNAAT: A Lightweight DNA Alignment Tool

DNAAT is a lightweight and simple tool for performing local and global DNA sequence alignments. It is written in Python and uses C-implemented functions for improved performance. This tool is designed for quick and easy use without the need for heavy dependencies or complex installations.

-----

## Features

  * **Global DNA sequence alignments**: Compare sequences of similar length.
  * **Local DNA sequence alignments**: Find the best region of similarity between two sequences.
  * **Lightweight and easy to use**: Designed for simplicity and minimal setup.
  * **Performance Testing**: Includes a script to compare the performance of the Python and C implementations.

## Getting Started

To get started with DNAAT, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/no1berg/DNAAT.git
    cd DNAAT
    ```

2.  **Run an alignment:**

      * For **global alignment**, run:
        ```bash
        python global_alignment.py
        ```
      * For **local alignment**, run:
        ```bash
        python aligner.py
        ```

3.  **Test Performance:**
    To see the performance boost from the C implementation, run:

    ```bash
    python test_performance.py
    ```
